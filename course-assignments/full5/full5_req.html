<p style="line-height: normal">In addition you will define a '<font face="Consolas">Manager</font>' 
module that contains the starting execution point for the 
your program (the <font face="Consolas">start()</font> or the<font face="Consolas"> 
main()</font> function). The capabilities of this module can be written purely 
in a procedural manner (functions instead of classes and methods). At a minimum 
the functions in this module should be able to: 1) prompt the user for
<a href="#Examples_of_determining_the_number_of_interactions_that_the_simulation_will_run">the number of interactions to occur when the program runs</a>, 
2) prompt the user for the<a href="#The_probability_of_the_Target_object_exhibiting_type_X_interactions"> 
probability of x-type interactions for the target</a> 3) instantiate instances 
of the Pursuer and Target class inside of one of the Manager's functions. 
Finally the 'main loop' (that executes a number of times equal to the specified 
number of interactions) will be inside a function of the Manager. The 
appropriate methods of the pursuer and the target should be called within the 
body of this loop.</p>

<p style="line-height: normal">The program will then automatically determine the probability 
of type 'Y' interactions for the target object from the probability of X interactions. (The sum 
total of the two percentages must equal 100).</p>
<p style="line-height: normal">The probability of each type of interaction 
exhibited by the pursuer will depend upon the version of program that you 
implement. The simplistic approach will allow for an equal probability of 
type-X and type-Y behaviors (the &quot;hope for the best&quot; approach to relationships)<sup>1</sup>. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal">
The date will then run one interaction at a time. During each interaction the 
pursuer and the target will exhibit one of two behaviors: 'X' or 'Y'. If both 
the pursuer and target exhibit the same behavior during a particular interaction (i.e. both 
were 'X' or both were 'Y') then that particular interaction is deemed as successful (and is 
counted in a tally). Otherwise the interaction is deemed as unsuccessful. Next 
the <i>pursuer will display a report</i>
describing the results of the interaction between the pursuer and target:</p>

behavior</font>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally when the specified number of interactions have occurred, the final 
analysis of the date will be <i>displayed by a method of the Pursuer</i>. The 
report should include the total number of X-type interactions and Y-type 
interactions generated by the target and the pursuer. (Note: because the number 
of X's and Y's is already tracked by the target, the pursuer need not track this 
information again, it can simply get that information from the target). Next the 
program should show 
the number of and percentage proportion of successful interactions. (The 
percentage is equal to the number of successful interactions divided by the 
total number of interactions multiplied by 100).&nbsp; Finally the 
report should determine if the date was successful or if it failed (the former 
if the proportion of successful interactions was 50% or greater, the latter 
otherwise).</p>

assignment? Because this isn't a formal class in Artificial Intelligence the 
definition is fairly broad. The pursuer demonstrates the ability to 
adapt to the pattern exhibited by the target and the marker can clearly see the pattern as 
the program executes (the display of statistics each round will be very useful). 
You can choose how many interactions will pass before the pursuer begins to adapt 
to the pattern (but it must be greater than zero interactions otherwise there is 
no 'pattern'). You can either come up with your own algorithm 
for the intelligent pursuer or you can freely research algorithms online. In the latter 
case make sure you clearly cite all your sources. (Failing to list a source may 
be regarded as academic misconduct).</p>
<p>If the need arises you can employ a fourth module called &quot;<font face="Consolas">Globals.py</font>&quot; 
which contains the definitions for global constants (these are globals&nbsp;that are used in multiple modules - constants that are used in only one classes' 
methods can be defined in the same file module as the definition of the class). 
Global variables should not be employed in this assignment (unless you want to 
define/employ) another debugging tool.</p>
