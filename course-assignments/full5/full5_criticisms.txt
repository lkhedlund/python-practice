NOTES ABOUT THIS ASSIGNMENT:

If I was to design this assignment I would remove a lot of the
redundant code. Target and Pursuer both 'act the same', so a Class
they can both use to pull attributes and methods from would be far
more efficient. I would choose this approach for the assignment if
 the guidelines didn't require me to follow the strict rules of
 each having their own attributes and methods.
